    <h4>I've been studing for 2 month now. I've been working with <strong>Python, HTML, CSS, Lua, C#, C++, JavaScript and Git.</strong></h4>  


    <p>It has been challenging to say the least but I love the challenge coding brings me. 
        I am determined to change my life and becoming a seasoned Software Developer. 
        I have many projects, this website being the first of many that I've been woking on. 
        Links to my projects and they're code will be down below. 
        Please take a look if your interested and thank you!, for visiting my site!!!
